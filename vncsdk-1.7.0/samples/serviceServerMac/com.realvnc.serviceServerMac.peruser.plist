  <!-- This is a hack to work around a bug in launchd on MacOS 10.10.  We
       really just want KeepAlive=true here, but it fails to start agents for
       newly-created accounts.  For some reason, using QueueDirectories seems
       to avoid this bug even though it's not really what we want at all. -->

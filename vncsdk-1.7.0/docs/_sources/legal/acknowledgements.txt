    The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with 
    respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a 
    particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume 
    the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

    This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except 
    as specified below.

    Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or 
    portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

    (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README 
        file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and 
        any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated 
        in accompanying documentation. 
    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must 
        state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". 
    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full 
        responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for 
        damages of any kind.

    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just 
    to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in 
    advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This 
    software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial 
    products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

    ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole 
    proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT 
    covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution 
    terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code 
    if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c 
    is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you 
    more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright 
    by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its 
    supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support 
    script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

    It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents 
    owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without 
    obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been 
    removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal 
    gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will 
    support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement 
    with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF 
    writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the 
    LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all 
    standard GIF decoders.

    We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of 
    CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."
